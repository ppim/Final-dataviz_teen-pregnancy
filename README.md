# Final-dataviz_teen-pregnancy
Final project: Teen pregnancy rate in NYC
Plese, trust me this is my big journey with Data viz !! 
- This semester I do an internship with NYC Health Department in Data communication unit. ( When I apply I imagine that I can practice and use data viz skill here but the reality they just need someone who can do some graphic, but it's fine because I have limited coding skill too, lol)
- I chose teen pregnancy data because I working on making infographic which I add on the website. and want to show the relationship between the decrease in pregnancy rates and increase the rate of use contraception and birth rate per borough. I avoid using race indicator which I hate to categorize people by race.
- I first thought about an example that scrolls down and the graph change.
- I plan to do: the right side is a data of birth rates in 5 boroughs in NYC. Left is a year and when you scroll down you will see the rate change. Unfortunately, I notice later that the change is very small compared with the portion of the graph so they seem like nothing change. (I upload my first draft file name pregnancy in NYC.) So I learn that I have to choose the data set wisely for the next time.
- I change my plan to categorize by age group and keep my goal interactive.
- I attached some infographic image from my work.
- Throughout this journey is high and low emotion. I'm superrrrr excited every time I can make a change even just set a margin or change color on an SVG code. Love that success moment. But when I couldn't figure out how to change it too frustrating too. I spend 2 hours just want to change the size of a graph from Highchart. To be honest, I got help from my friend to make the graph animate after I spend a whole day and give up. and He just needs 1 hours to fix it. The world so unfair, lol. 
- I learn that I like doing this but need more time and help to fix some point. I really great to have some sit together and help me fix it the error. Plus, I learn about the new app that I can video call and share my screen with my friends in Thailand and then we can code together. 
- I know, this doesn't look super pretty but I proud of it that I made this at the end! :)
- I'm obsessed with space between character, text, space between the line. After frustrated about the spacing, I found that I used to use word kerning and leading in editorial design but in coding they use padding. the leading still weird but.... I will practice more.

THANKSSS :)
